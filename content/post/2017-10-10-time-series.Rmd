Hello, this time we are going to look at data visualization with using time series. To start we bring down the libraries again.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Now, we will look at Babe Ruth's homeruns over his 22 seasons.Below is the sql inquiry.  

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now, we will put this data into a time series visualization. With the time series plot, it will allow us to connect the data points to make a line showing a great visualization!

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Babe Ruth's Homeruns by Year")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Number of Homeruns")
```

Now you have learned another visualization of time series!
