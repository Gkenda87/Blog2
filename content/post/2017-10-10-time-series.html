<p>Hello, this time we are going to look at data visualization with using time series. To start we bring down the libraries again.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
library(devtools)</code></pre>
<p>Now, we will look at Babe Ruthâ€™s homeruns over his 22 seasons.Below is the sql inquiry.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)
#Now, we will put this data into a time series visualization. With the time series plot, it will allow us to connect the data points to make a line showing a great visualization!
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
