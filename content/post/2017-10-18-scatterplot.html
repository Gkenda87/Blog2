<p>The scatter plot is the first data visualization that we will do. So, letâ€™s take the homeruns and strikeouts from the Lahman database and make a scatterplot.</p>
<p>First, we will load our libraries. This will tell the computer what sets of data we are going to identify.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
library(devtools)</code></pre>
<p>Onto the next step! We are going to look at the career homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR),sum(SO)
#FROM Batting
#GROUP BY playerID
#HAVING sum(HR)&gt;400&quot;
#sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the information, we will save it as a result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS Career_HR,sum(SO) As Career_SO 
FROM Batting GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)&gt;=400&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)
#Now the data will turn into points by associating the homeruns with the y-axis and strikeouts with the x-axis. Also, we will add the graph title and the axis labels. 
ggplot()+  
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=Career_SO,y=Career_HR),size=3)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Career Strikeouts and Homeruns&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Career Strikeouts&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Career Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>YAY!! Now you know how to make a scatter plot!</p>
