Now we are moving onto histograms! 

Let's look at the weights of MLB players throught the Master table in the Lahman database.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Below is the sqldf inquiry:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT weight FROM Master"
result<-sqldf(query)
#The next step is like the other visualizations, putting it in the ggplot script. 
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=60)+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Baseball Player Bodyweight")+
  xlab("Weight of player")+
  ylab("Number of players")
```


See the histogram was not too bad! The bins we see on this visualization represent the numbers of bars shown.
